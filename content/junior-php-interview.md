On January 27, 2022, I had the opportunity to publicly talk a little more about my work for the first time. When I first encountered Magento two years earlier, I could not have predicted that it would become an inseparable part of my life. But let's start from the beginning.

## How I got into Strix?
All thanks to youthful bravery. After two years of working with PHP in the e-commerce industry, I decided to look for new challenges. I submitted my resume, despite the fact that I had not worked in this technology before, and I received a phone call with a proposal to participate in the "Magento Academy". This is how my adventure with Strix began. After two years and participation in two large projects, I was asked to share my experiences and thoughts on the PHP ecosystem and my first steps in this industry.

## Where did the idea for the interview come from?
In the era of dynamic development of web technologies, PHP programming remains one of the foundations of creating modern web applications. Many novice programmers wonder how to effectively enter this career path and how to develop their skills to achieve success. When I started my adventure with programming, I had the same, and that was the motivation for conducting this interview.

## What are we talking about?
How did I start my programming adventure? What did I learn at school and how did it help me at work? What was my path from junior to regular? Why is it worth working with Magento? Does working with this technology have a future?

I talked about all these things with Karolina as part of the series "How IT works?" 

Unfortunately, the entire conversation is conducted in Polish, and there is no option to turn on automatic translation in the video.
